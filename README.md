Project Description

The World Health Organization reports that close to 800,000 people die by committing sui-cide every year, which is almost 1 person every 40 seconds. This is very disturbing as it is a preventable health problem, but still a leading cause of death worldwide.

Reports from the American Psychological Association show us that the USA alone has recorded a substantial increase in the rate of suicide, increasing by 33 percent from 1999 through 2017 or from 10.5 to 14 suicides per 100,000 people. It ranks as the second most common cause for deaths among people in the 10 - 34 year age range, and is the fourth lead-ing cause of death for people ages 35 to 54 in the US. Sadly, 90%of those who died by suicide had a diagnosable mental health condition at the time of their death. Globally, suicide ranks as the 10th leading cause of death overall.

Our dataset includes the global rates of suicides per country, and includes characteristics such as age, gender, Gross Domestic Product and Human Development Index respectively, and would be helpful in understanding the variation in suicide rates across di erent countries. Suicide rates around the world have been increasing every year, and we want to analyze the relationship between these factors to better understand the reasons and common factors that contribute to this.



Dataset Description

The dataset we are using is the Suicide Rates Overview-1985 to 2016 dataset from Kaggle, and will be used to derive correlations between different attributes to understand the variation in suicide rates among different countries globally. Our data contains a total of 12 columns and 27,821 observations.

•	Country - each country to which the observations belong to Year - when these observations were recorded

•	Sex - gender of the subjects

•	Age - age brackets of the subjects

•	Suicides no - total number of cases of suicides recorded in that country Population - total population of the country

•	Suicides/100k pop - number of suicides per a 100,000 people Country-year - contains the country name and the year

•	HDI for a year - human development index for that year

•	Gdp for year ($) - GDP for a particular year

•	Gdp per capita ($) - GDP over the population for that year

•	Generation - splits the population based on the generation they were born in - G.I Generation, Silent Generation, Boomers, Generation X, Millenials, Generation Z


Out of these variables Year, Suicides no, Population, Suicides/100k pop, HDI for a year, Gdp for year and Gdp per capita are quantitative variables, while Sex and Generation are categorical variables.
 
Research Question

We want to understand the following:

How does the suicide rate vary per country after accounting for the GDP, Human Development Index and Age group of the population of that country?

Considering Suicides/100k pop as the response variable, we would like to perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship it shares with age and across generations, gender, the per capita GDP and the HDI of a population, across countries. We will work on plotting this information to see how suicide rates vary with increase/decrease in GDP and HDI, and with categorical variables like Sex, Country, Age etc. Examples of specific questions we can look into are whether rich countries have a lower suicide rate or which gender has a higher rate of suicide and so on.
